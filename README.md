# Dendro

## Introduction
Dendro is a lamp that can change colour according to the detected indoor air quality. The air quality is detected by an air quality sensor.
When the light is green, it means that the air quality is good. When it's yellow, it means that the air quality is slightly polluted. When it's red, it means that the air quality is heavily polluted.
